        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Its origins are still up for debate. Its namesake, General Zuo Zongtang, almost certainly never tasted the
          dish
          before his death in 1885 and, as Lee discovers, his descendants—many of whom still reside in the General's
          hometown
          of Xiangyin—don't recognize the dish as a family heirloom, or even as particularly Chinese, for that matter.
        </p>

        <p>The late Ed Schoenfeld, proprietor of New York's Red Farm and one of the world's experts on Chinese-American
          cuisine, traced its origins to Chef Peng Jia, a Hunanese chef who fled to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution.
          Made
          with un-battered large chunks of dark meat chicken tossed in a tart sauce, it was more savory than sweet. It
          wasn't
          until a New York-based chef, T.T. Wang, learned the recipe from Peng in Taiwan, brought it back, added a
          crispy
          deep-fried coating and sugar to the sauce, and changed the name to General Ching's that it stuck, eventually
          making
          its way onto Chinese menus across the country and the globe.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>For the Marinade:</strong> Beat egg whites in a large bowl until broken down and lightly
                foamy. Add
                soy sauce, wine, and vodka and whisk to combine. Set aside half of marinade in a small bowl. Add
                cornstarch
                and baking soda to the large bowl and whisk to combine. Add chicken to large bowl and turn with fingers
                to
                coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
              <li><strong>For the Dry Coat:</strong> Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
                Whisk
                until homogeneous. Add reserved marinade and whisk until mixture has coarse, mealy clumps. Set aside.
              </li>
              <li><strong>To Fry Chicken:</strong> Heat 1 1/2 quarts peanut, vegetable, or canola oil in a large wok or
                Dutch
                oven to 350°F (177°C) and adjust flame to maintain temperature</li>
              <li>Working one piece at a time, transfer chicken from marinade to dry coat mixture, tossing in between
                each
                addition to coat chicken. When all chicken is added to dry coat, toss with hands, pressing dry mixture
                onto
                chicken so it adheres, and making sure that every piece is coated thoroughly.</li>
              <li>Lift chicken one piece at a time, shake off excess coating, and carefully lower into hot oil (do not
                drop
                it). Once all chicken is added, cook, agitating with long chopsticks or a metal spider, and adjusting
                flame to
                maintain a temperature of 325 to 375°F (163 to 191°C), until chicken is cooked through and very crispy,
                about
                4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined bowl to drain. Pour frying oil through a fine-mesh
                strainer
                set over a large heatproof bowl; allow to cool, then reserve for future frying.</li>
              <li>For the Sauce and to Finish: Combine sugar, chicken stock, soy sauce, wine, vinegar, cornstarch, and
                sesame
                oil in a small bowl and stir with a fork until cornstarch is dissolved and no lumps remain. Set aside.
              </li>
              <li>Combine oil, garlic, ginger, minced scallions, and red chiles in a wok or large skillet and place over
                medium heat. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are aromatic and soft, but not browned, about 3 minutes.
                Stir
                sauce mixture and add to wok, making sure to scrape out any sugar or starch that has sunk to the bottom
                of
                bowl. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute. Add scallion segments.</li>
              <li>Add chicken to sauce, then toss, folding it with a wok spatula or silicone spatula until all pieces
                are
                thoroughly coated. Serve immediately with white rice.</li>
