        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Chicken Marsala is a classic Italian-American dish that's crowd-pleasing, quick, and irresistible. The
          slightly
          sweet and savory sauce made of mushrooms, aromatics, and Marsala wine is straight-up drinkable, thanks to
          the
          not-so-traditional addition of heavy cream. It's the perfect weeknight dinner, and we don't even feel guilty
          making
          it three nights in a row. It's a real plus that this dish comes together in just 35 minutes.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>Pat chicken dry and remove tenderloin from breasts. Butterfly each breast, then separate butterflied
                halves to create 4-6 thin pieces; season both sides of chicken with pepper, Italian seasoning, and 1 1/2
                teaspoons salt.</li>
              <li>Pour flour into a shallow dish. Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, coating both sides, and tap off
                any
                excess.</li>
              <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil, then melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add
                half
                of chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a
                plate.
                Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining chicken.</li>
              <li>In same skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring
                occasionally,
                until softened, about 5 minutes. Add shallot and remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt and
                cook,
                stirring frequently, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until
                fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping browned bits from bottom
                of
                pan, until reduced by half, 4 to 5 minutes. Add broth and cream and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring
                occasionally, until sauce starts to thicken, about 15 minutes.</li>
              <li>Stir in remaining 2 tablespoon butter until melted. Return chicken to skillet spoon sauce over chicken
                until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Top with parsley.</li>
