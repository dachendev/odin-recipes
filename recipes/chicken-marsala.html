    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Chicken Marsala is a classic Italian-American dish that's crowd-pleasing, quick, and irresistible. The slightly sweet and savory sauce made of mushrooms, aromatics, and Marsala wine is straight-up drinkable, thanks to the not-so-traditional addition of heavy cream. It's the perfect weeknight dinner, and we don't even feel guilty making it three nights in a row. It's a real plus that this dish comes together in just 35 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts (2 to 3)</li>
      <li>1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp. Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>2 tsp. Kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>8 oz. cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. chopped fresh thyme</li>
      <li>3/4 c. Marsala wine</li>
      <li>1 1/4 c. low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>3/4 c. heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Pat chicken dry and remove tenderloin from breasts. Butterfly each breast, then separate butterflied halves to create 4-6 thin pieces; season both sides of chicken with pepper, Italian seasoning, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.</li>
      <li>Pour flour into a shallow dish. Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, coating both sides, and tap off any excess.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil, then melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add half of chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining chicken.</li>
      <li>In same skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add shallot and remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping browned bits from bottom of pan, until reduced by half, 4 to 5 minutes. Add broth and cream and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce starts to thicken, about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in remaining 2 tablespoon butter until melted. Return chicken to skillet spoon sauce over chicken until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Top with parsley.</li>
